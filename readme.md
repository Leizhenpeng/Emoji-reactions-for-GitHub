# Emoji reactions for GitHub 

## Overview

The Emoji Reactions for GitHub is a lightweight Chrome extension designed to enhance the code review process on GitHub. It allows users to add emoji reactions directly to lines of code in a pull request. Acting on behalf of the user, it seamlessly integrates into the GitHub interface, offering a more interactive and expressive way to communicate feedback during reviews.
